== Description ==

This add-on enables you to limit the number of times a subscription level can be purchased on your membership site powered by Restrict Content Pro. After the limit has been reached, the subscription level is deactivated, hiding it from the registration form. Existing subscribers will continue to be billed, if they are set up for automatic renewals.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How does it work? =
When a subscription is configured for limited availability, each time that level is purchased the total number of sales for that level is incremented. When the total number of sales reaches the maximum quantity available, the level is deactivated so that it is hidden from the registration form. Existing subscribers will continue to be billed, if they are set up for automatic renewals, and they will continue to have access to the restricted content their membership provides until their membership expires or is cancelled.
